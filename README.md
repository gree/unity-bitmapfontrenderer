### Introduction

unity-bitmapfontrenderer is similar to Unity's TextMesh implementation, which displays text strings in the game scene. Both use a single bitmap texture, which includes the glyphs of every single character, and a mesh, which is dynamically generated by the renderer. The advantage of unity-bitmapfontrenderer is that it is *open-source*.
